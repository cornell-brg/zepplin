Dependencies
==========================================================================

Zeppelin requires the following:

* `CMake <https://cmake.org/>`_ (as well as any preferred backend, such as
  Ninja)
* `GCC <https://gcc.gnu.org/>`_
* The `RISCV toolchain <https://github.com/riscv-collab/riscv-gnu-toolchain>`_, for cross-compiling
* One of the following (for Verilog simulation):

  * `Synopsys VCS <https://www.synopsys.com/verification/simulation/vcs.html>`_
  * `Verilator <https://www.veripool.org/verilator/>`_

Exact versions required are unknown, but all functionality was successfully
demonstrated on the BRG research server. Those looking to replicate should
aim for:

* CMake >= 3.10
* GCC >= 13 (necessary for using ``<format>``)
* RISCV Toolchain built 2025 or later (we built in Jan. 2025)
* Verilator >= 5.032

Note that the build system is currently only intended to work on Linux systems.
In particular, MacOS doesn't natively support ELF utilities (i.e. ``elf.h``),
and has particular command-line flags with CMake that don't work with the
RISCV toolchain. Further work could be done for this use case, but isn't
needed at this time.

.. admonition:: Verilator Version

   Recent Verilator releases disallow function calls into tasks (see the
   `FUNCTIMECTL <https://verilator.org/guide/latest/warnings.html#cmdoption-arg-FUNCTIMECTL>`_
   warning). The ``init_mem`` flow in the simulator wrappers triggers this
   on un-waived builds; the project waiver file
   (``verilator_waivers.vlt``) suppresses it, but the underlying call
   shape should eventually be cleaned up.
